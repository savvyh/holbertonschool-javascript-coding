# NodeJS

# General üß©
1. Running JavaScript with Node.js: Node.js lets you run server-side JavaScript code outside of a web browser using a virtual machine called V8, originally developed by Google for Chrome.

2. Using Node.js modules: Node.js modules are pre-built JavaScript code libraries that can be added to a project using the `require()` command, providing additional functionalities.

3. Reading files with the Node.js `fs` module: The Node.js `fs` module allows manipulation of files on the local file system, offering methods for reading, writing, modifying, and deleting files.

4. Accessing command line arguments and environment with `process`: Node.js' `process` object provides information about the current running `process`, including command line arguments and environment variables.

5. Creating an HTTP server with Node.js: Node.js makes it easy to create HTTP servers using the http module to listen on a specific port and respond to incoming HTTP requests.

6. Creating an HTTP server with Express.js: Express.js simplifies HTTP server creation by providing powerful features for routing, request handling, and more, making it a popular choice for web development with Node.js.

7. Creating advanced routes with Express.js: Express.js allows defining routes to handle different types of HTTP requests to specific URLs, offering advanced features like route parameters and middleware.

8. Using ES6 with Node.js via Babel-node: ES6 introduces new features like classes and modules to JavaScript. Babel-node allows executing ES6 code directly in Node.js by converting it into a compatible version.

9. Using Nodemon for faster development: Nodemon monitors changes in files of a Node.js project and automatically restarts the server, facilitating a smooth and efficient development `process`.


### Requirements üëá
- All files should be verified by ESLINT : `npx eslint --fix filename.js`
- All functions/classes must be exported by using this format: `module.exports = myFunction;`

### Tasks üì°
0. Executing basic javascript with Node JS : create a function named `displayMessage` that prints in `STDOUT` the string argument.
1. Using Process stdin : It souhld display a message and user quand answer it.
2. Reading a file synchronously with Node JS.
3. Reading a file asynchronously with Node JS.
4. Create a small HTTP server using Node's HTTP module.
5. Create a more complex HTTP server using Node's HTTP module.
6. Create a small HTTP server using Express.
7. Create a more complex HTTP server using Express.
8. Organize a complex HTTP server using Express.
    - 8.1 Organize the structure of the server.
    - 8.2 Write the App controller.
    - 8.3 Write the Students controller.
    - 8.4 Write the routes.
    - 8.5 Write the server reusing everything you created.
    - 8.6 Update package.json.
